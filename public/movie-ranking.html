<h3>Like Stars on Earth</h3>
<p>
   Beautiful film. My favourite ever since I was little, <br /> 
   A lot of lessons to learn from. 
</p>

<h3>Strange Magic</h3>
<p>
   I think this animated movie is very underrated. <br /> 
   Good musical, and lots of realization about love.

<h3>Nemona</h3>
<p>I find this animated movie so fun. It's oddly satisfying.</p>
